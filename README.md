What is NPM & package.json ?
What is Vite?

answer 1a:
 NPM (Node Package Manager) it is a tool that is used for Installing packages or libraries like react, vites ..., it also manages project dependencies this tool comes automatically with Node.js.. 
in summary, when you run "npm install react", it downloads react into your project.

answer 1b:
package.json is a file that is created automatically in every Node project.
It stores information about the project, such like the project name, the project version, the dependencies (React, Vite, Tailwind, etc.) as well as the scripts (like npm run dev)..

answer 2:
Vite is a tool used to run and build frontend applications very fast. It is mostly used with React, Vue, Svelte, etc. using vites in a project, gives user a very fast local development server (npm run dev) a fast hot reload (changes update in the browser instantly) a production build tools and also a  clean project setup. Compared to ordinary create a react app, using vite makes the project faster regardless of the project size.
